Non-native childrenâ€™s English speech (NNCES) corpus
There were a total of 50 children, 25 females and 25 males, ranging in age from 8 to 12. All of the children are native speakers of Telugu, an Indian regional language, who are learning English as a second language. All of the audio clips were acquired in a .wav file using the open source SurveyLex platform, which supports dual channel at 44.1 kHz and a data rate of 16 bits per sample. Every questionnaire is conducted 10 times per child to assess the variation in words and sentences.
The data was recorded for a total around 20  hours. It incorporates both read speech, with a total of 5000 utterances, and spontaneous speech, with a total of 5000 utterances with word level transcription.
